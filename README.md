* Fall Theme Extension
** Created by TheChar

This theme is inspired by the season of Fall and the brilliant colors it gives to the world.
The Fall Theme is part of my seasons theme collection! The other themes are still in development,
but as soon as they are released I'll put their names and links here.

Have feedback/suggestions? My website (see below) will soon have a feedback form. Simply tell me
that you have feedback about my vscode fall theme, and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Want to know more about me and my projects?
I'm working on a website right now and don't know when it will be finished.
You can check it out [here](thechar.github.io).
